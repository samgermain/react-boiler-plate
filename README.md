- ESLint with [`xo`](https://github.com/xojs/xo) style guide
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for CSS linting. I am including the 'standard [configuration](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/configure)' with some additional rules to keep things alphabetical, indented with `2` spaces, etc.
- [`husky`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) will check over code quality with the linters b4 there is a successful `commit`.
- Various VS Code 'settings' and 'extensions.' **Look in the bottom right when you open this up in VS Code to install them.**

## How To Use

Run `npm i` to get all the things installed.

Meanwhile, you will get alerted whenever there is something 'bad' in your code based on the aforementioned üëÜüèΩ linting.
